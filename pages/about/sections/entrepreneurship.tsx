          <h2>Entrepreneurship</h2>
          <p>
            Co-founded an ecommerce with my good friend Xavi on 2011, we ourselves manufactured the
            buttons with a couple of machines we bought.
          </p>
          <p>
            We created a custom ecommerce site from scratch with PHP/MySQL that allowed us to
            customize price on our own, I even created an online custom designer with jQuery{' '}
            <span role="img" aria-label="saint">
              ðŸ˜‡
            </span>
            .
          </p>
          <p>
            Learned a toon of SEO and we managed to create a 10k monthly turnover within six months
            and 0 spent on marketing.
          </p>
          <p>I still dream on creating a company from scratch.</p>
