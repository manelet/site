        <h2>Entrepreneurship</h2>
        <p>
          Co-founded an ecommerce with my good friend Xavi on 2011, we ourselves manufactured the
          buttons with a couple of machines we bought.
        </p>
        <p>
          We created a custom ecommerce site from scratch with PHP/MySQL that allowed us to
          customize price on our own, I even created an online custom designer with jQuery{' '}
          <span role="img" aria-label="saint">
            ðŸ˜‡
          </span>
          .
        </p>
        <p>
          Learned a toon of SEO and we managed to create a 10k monthly turnover within six months
          and 0 spent on marketing.
        </p>
        <p>I still dream on creating a company from scratch.</p>
