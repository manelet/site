            The two things that I liked to do the most as a child were playing football, I played
            for several teams until 16yo because of an injury but I still love playing from time to
            time.

            The other one are computers, since a very child I&apos;ve been passionate about
            computers, software and technology in general. Ah, I also played a lot of video games{' '}

            I still do remember myself toying with Frontpage 98 with 10yo playing with tables to
            create layouts and going crazy trying to align images. At that time it was more like a
            kind of &quot;painting&quot; and having fun rather than developing, but it created the
            needed curiosity to keep digging.

            Some years after I started playing Counter-Strike (a lot) and it was then when I really
            started to learn programming, some design ideas and how a website was made from the
            inside, whithout a proper website, your clan wasn&apos;t going to be popular{' '}
